# Project Proposal

## 1. Proposal
Title: Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning on AWS for Brain Tumor
Classification from MRI Data

## 2. Dataset Information: The MRI dataset for brain tumor classification, available on Kaggle, is employed
for this project under the CC0 license, facilitating collaborative research and innovation in the medical field.

## 3. Project Overview:
Objective: Brain tumors present intricate challenges due to variations in size and location. Accurate
analysis often necessitates the expertise of a neurosurgeon. In regions with limited access to skilled
professionals, the interpretation of MRI scans is time-consuming and challenging. This project seeks to
address this issue through an automated cloud-based system.

## 4. Outcome:
Development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MRI image classification on the
AWS cloud platform.

## 5. Cloud Services Utilized: The project leverages AWS resources, EC2 Instances, and Flask.
